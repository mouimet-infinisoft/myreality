love is a composition of time, magnetism, energy, up and down, ascension, regression, 
amplitude, sens, direction, attraction, repulsion, wave. therefore all these proeprties all 
together forms energy and vibration.. this is the only force that can overpass between 
different planes..

love is the light


no other forces combines all properties together.. so they must stay between plan limits and 
boundraries..

does that make sens?


for that reason.. there is alot of people like you and me.. we are hyper sensible person and we 
are able to feel magnetism... anybody could if there are open to it...

force is what have impact on the properties.. the direction or the sens you take .. you are 
under impression its not your choice but it is. Where you choose to put your force sii having 
direct causal effect on these properties. Therefore if you love something badly, your gonna 
take a direction implicitly. And this is called the free will....


or karma

there is 4 forces


Magnetism = time 

Mass = amount

Acceleration = intensity

Atraction = frequence


so if you put a certain amount of time frequently 
with intensity... 


its goonna make sens to go in that direction
